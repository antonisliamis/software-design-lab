# $NAME's Course Goals
ANTONIOS LIAMIS

Benchmark: Learning though Python projects
## Goal One
Through that course I will try to learn Python as it's said the most popular language in Digital Humanities.
As a Web designer I'm quite familiar HTML and CSS  and a little a bit of Jqueries but I haven't dug much into it programming. Being recently a UX Designer-Researcher I think Python will provide me definitely with more development skills to understand better Web development methods and practices.

Benchmark:  Familiarizing with Python's syntax and rules through data-focused libraries I can deploy it as a powerful tool to visualize and manipulate data.

## Goal Two
Programming languages have always come and gone. But I think that Python has become here to stay. In the field of Data Analysis many languages can be useful like SQL or R. But I'm convinced that Python's versatility and applicability are on top of all. One of my big goals in that MA program is to get involved more with text processing and mapping and digital pedagogy. Iâ€™m almost sure that Python has a go-to language for data analysis.

Benchmark: Building a safe online DIY community platform for Kids
## Goal Three

I hope Python will provide me with a basic knowledge (firstly local host and then online) making a platform for Children and Parents. It would be a learning interaction space but also a means of communication with Kids DIYers from all over the world who happen to share the same interests, learn how to share information and exhibit their projects in an instructional how-to format.
