## Week Two (1/30 to 2/6)

This week, I spent  my time reviewing Git and the Command line, including two hours with the DHRI command line tutorial.
I was not familiar with Git Hub so I dedicated extra time to read tutorial, how the Git Hub is working OR how to make forked projects and upload files through Command line. As an International student without my English being my native language I have been making extra efforts to understand the lectures during the class and also dedicate a bit more time to comprehend your useful weekly related tutorials.

Hour 2: Git review using Pro Git book
Hour 3: Create my Git Profile and using Command line to uploads my own repositories

Hour 5: Reading DHRI Git tutorial
Hour 6: Reading Command Line Crash Course (from Learn Python the Hard Way)


## Week Three (1/7 to 2/13)
This week, I spent part of my time reviewing Python and trying to use Command line to practice with Python Scripts.I found  it quite difficult as I am not familiar with this particular programming language.I'm a bit confused with the symbols between Python 2 and Python3. While I was informed that Python2 and Anaconda2 was that one that we have to download, I realized in class that we have to be work with Python3 .I reinstalled the new version of Python and I started to run scripts that we have learned during the course.

## Week Four 14/2 to 2/20)
This week, I spent part of my time reviewing Python though https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/  .I learn some practices through the exercises and also the new commands we learned during the class. My main focus was particularly in HTML and CSS though W3Schools.I also paid a little attention and read https://www.sonniesedge.net/talks/dear-developer which I found very interesting particularly the reference for the bootstrap technology. I wish we could find some time to spend more time in the class to that.

To be frank I didnt understand much their meaning although I read all the introduction to Programming Paradigms.My goal is to study again on those and specificall to Object Oriented Programming (OOP)] Although I keep on studying Python language thorough Lynda.com and I started also to make all the exercises through "Learn Python the Hard Way"

This week, I was very impressed by our Visitor Designers as I found  a lot of intersting things regarding the User Experience Methods.I actually asked from Clara to send me mere detaila for User Experience Methods as I'm working  freelancing a UX Designer. I also didnt't have tha chance to deep into Jekyll some weeks ago. So I grabbed the chance to read some more tutorials on that.
My goal is to find more time to learn Python though cause that my main matter in the Lab.

## Week Ten  -)
This week, I was dedicated at my  Homework project regarding the description I wanted to present in the class. Although I found my command line project very interesting and I wish it could be voted from the other students it didn't succeeded in being selected.May be also it was my mistake as I uploaded it the last minute before going to the class and the students didn't have the chance to read it knowingly.But I would like to be participate in a group with commnand line. Finally I chose to be in the group making Sql Database with Rob and Liza and I was very happy about that. Lerning Sql is challenging for me to  as I have a basic knowledge in terms of making websites through various CMS platforms.
