# $NAME's Technical Journal

## Week Two (1/30 to 2/6)

This week, I spent  my time reviewing Git and the Command line, including two hours with the DHRI command line tutorial.
I was not familiar with Git Hub so I dedicated extra time to read tutorial, how the Git Hub is working OR how to make forked projects and upload files through Command line. As an International student without my English being my native language I have been making extra efforts to understand the lectures during the class and also dedicate a bit more time to comprehend your useful weekly related tutorials.

## Week Three (1/7 to 2/13)

This week, I spent part of my time reviewing Python and trying to use Command line to practice with Python Scripts.I found  it quite difficult as I am not familiar with this particular programming language.I'm a bit confused with the symbols between Python 2 and Python3. While I was informed that Python2 and Anaconda2 was that one that we have to download, I realized in class that we have to be work with Python3 .I reinstalled the new version of Python and I started to run scripts that we have learned during the course.
